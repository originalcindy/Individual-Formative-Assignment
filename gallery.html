            <h1>Age Equality</h1>
        </div>
        <h1>Age equality is the idea that all people should be treated equally, regardless of their age, and have
            access
            to the same rights and opportunities. The Equality Act 2010 in the UK protects people from age
            discrimination in a number of ways.</h1>

    <h2>Ways in which age inequality occur</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct discrimination</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Happens When someone is treated worse than another person in a similar situation because of their age.
        When an organization has a policy or way of working that puts people of a certain age group at a
        disadvantage
        <ul>
            <li>Harassment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When someone makes you feel humiliated, offended, or degraded.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Victimisation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you are treated badly because you have made a complaint of age discrimination.
            The Equality Act also requires public bodies to consider the needs of older people when planning or carrying
            out
            their public duties or services.</p>
        <ul>
        <h2>Who it affects and why</h2>
        </ul>
        <p>age discrimination can affect people of all ages, but it particularly affects young and older people. The
            COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the intersectionality of age with other protected characteristics such as
            ethnicity and socio-economic status.</p>
        <h2>Age inequality can occur in several key areas</h2>
        <li>Employment</li>
        <p> Older applicants may be overlooked in favor of younger candidates perceived as more tech-savvy, while
            younger candidates may be deemed inexperienced.
            Age can influence who gets promoted, with older workers sometimes being passed over for younger, less
            experienced individuals.
        </p>
        <li>Wages</li>
        <p>Pay disparities can arise, where younger employees are paid less due to inexperience, while older workers
            may face wage stagnation or be offered lower salaries due to biases about their age.</p>
        <li>Training and Development</li>
        <p>Older workers may receive fewer opportunities for skill development, while younger workers might not be given
            the chance to prove their capabilities due to stereotypes about their age.
        </p>
        <li>Healthcare Access</li>
        <p>Older adults might face age-related biases in medical care, leading to inadequate treatment, while younger
            individuals may struggle to access certain services that cater to their needs.</p>
        <li>Social Services</li>
        <p>Allocation of resources, such as funding for youth programs or elderly care, can disproportionately benefit
            one age group over another.
        </p>
        <li>Cultural Representation</li>
        <p>Media often perpetuates stereotypes about different age groups, leading to a lack of diverse and accurate
            representations of both younger and older people.
        </p>
        <li>Cultural Representation</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Housing</li>
        <p>Discrimination in housing can occur, with older adults facing challenges in finding suitable accommodations,
            while younger individuals may struggle with affordability.</p>
