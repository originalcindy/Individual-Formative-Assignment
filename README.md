DESIGN

Colour Pallette 
![alt text](colourpaletteproject.png)
 
 I chose these colours as i felt they worked well visually. It took quite a while to find the right combination which would not clah with the the complexion of the woman in the hero image.

Typography
I chose san serif fonts as they work the best in media and print documents

For headers and footers

Google Fonts was used to import ozwald font For the rest of the site.


IMAGERY
I chose the image of a happy and smiling mature woman with a full smile. I chose this image because this lady looks like the embodiment of happiness and enjoying oneself as we get older.

PAGE FEATURES
At the top of the page i have a hero image and some text which highlights what age equality is
